# XWrap: A Simple C Wrapper Renderer of X11

XWrap is a lightweight and easy-to-use C library for rendering graphics on X11 window systems. It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating windows, drawing lines and shapes, and handling user input events.

## TODO

- make it header library
- make it dynamically link to `X11` in real time using `dlopen` and `dlsym`

## Dependency

```sh
$ sudo apt install libx11-dev
```
